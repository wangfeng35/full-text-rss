Site-specific extraction rules
This free version does not contain the site config files we include with purchased copies, but these are now all available online. If you'd like to keep yours up to date using Git, follow the steps below:

Change into the site_config/standard/ folder
Delete everything in there
Using the command line, enter: git clone https://github.com/fivefilters/ftr-site-config.git .
Git should now download the latest site config files for you.
To update the site config files again, you can simply run git pull from the directory.
